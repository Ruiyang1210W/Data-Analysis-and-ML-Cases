# Acknowledgments

## MIT IDSS Program

These projects were completed as part of the **MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) Data Science & Machine Learning Certificate Program**.

I would like to express my gratitude to:

- **MIT IDSS Faculty and Instructors** for providing rigorous training in data science fundamentals, machine learning algorithms, and practical applications
- **Program Coordinators** for designing comprehensive capstone projects that simulate real-world business challenges
- **MIT Professional Education** for creating accessible, high-quality educational opportunities

## Datasets

The datasets used in these projects were provided by MIT IDSS for educational purposes:

- **Amazon Product Reviews Dataset** (Project 1): Electronics category ratings
- **FoodHub Order Dataset** (Project 2): Food delivery platform order data
- **ExtraaLearn Lead Dataset** (Project 3): EdTech lead conversion data

These datasets are used exclusively for educational and should not be redistributed.

## Libraries and Tools

This work was made possible by the open-source community:

- **Python Software Foundation** for the Python programming language
- **NumFOCUS** for supporting NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter
- **Scikit-learn developers** for comprehensive machine learning tools
- **Surprise library contributors** for collaborative filtering implementations

## Inspiration

The recommendation system project draws inspiration from:
- Netflix Prize competition
- Amazon's item-to-item collaborative filtering approach
- Research on matrix factorization techniques by Koren, Bell, and Volinsky

## Statement

These projects represent original work completed independently as part of the MIT IDSS certification requirements. While the project frameworks and datasets were provided by MIT IDSS, all analysis, code implementation, insights, and recommendations are my own.
